We believe that everyone should be treated with respect and dignity.

We adhere to a high standard for respectful and professional interactions. Our Code of Conduct follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). We encourage all contributors to familiarize themselves with the Rust Code of Conduct.

As project maintainers, we have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, we commit ourselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project, and we expect all contributors to do the same.

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces, including public and private communication channels, such as mailing lists, social media, issue trackers, and chat rooms, as well as in-person events related to the project.

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the project maintainers at [joey@stockpile.so]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and we will take appropriate action to address the situation.
