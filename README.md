<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Stockpile is a decentralized funding engine for the open-internet. Leveraging the speed of Solana, the protocol facilitates 
  general crowdfunding campaigns, quadratic funding rounds, and fair hackathons with verifiable transfers/calculations, all at
  the speed of light. Stockpile is designed for builders and creators to leverage their communities to raise the funds needed
  for their next endeavor, and is (to our knowledge) the first of its kind on any blockchain.
</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>
      General Crowdfunding:
    </b>
    Inspired by the likes of Kickstarter and Indiegogo, the protocol features general crowdfunding by default, which is applicable
    for most projects and initiatives. This also features optional reward distribution via NFTs, which is handled on the frontend.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      Funding Rounds:
    </b>
    Stockpile features permissionless, configurable quadratic funding rounds hosted on-chain. Anyone with size is permitted to create
    a round to equitably fund projects and causes pertaining to the initiative their looking to move forward.
